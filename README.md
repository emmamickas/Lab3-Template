# Lab3

Follow KC's write up of the assignment here: https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/LAB3.html

It is preferred that you use the existing t.c format to place your code, however, you may modify it as long as the `mk` sh script compiles your code (which of course you may modify such that it does compile your code.)

As a tip: KC's MTX textbook has a better description of the code needed to pipe. 

## To Turn In:
Push your files to GitHub Classroom (see [here](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/ta_resources/howto-linux-cmds.html) for more details if you do not know how to submit using Git/GitHub Classroom).

Note you must `git push` your code to submit it. Submissions automatically occur based on the last pushed commit whenever the assignment is due.

## Samples
As usual, samples may be found at https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/samples/LAB3. You may download them via the `wget` utility (see the [How-To Linux Command page](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/ta_resources/howto-linux-cmds.html) on the course webpage if you are unfamiliar).

Note `lab3.bin` is an executable and may be run after using `chmod +x`, whereas `lab3base.c` is starter code.
